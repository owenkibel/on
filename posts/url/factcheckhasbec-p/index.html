<p>‘Fact check’ has become just another word for censorship</p>
<p>“Fact-checking” is like “fake news”: Something that is now entirely in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<h3 id="fact-checking-becoming-censorship" tabindex="-1"><a href="#fact-checking-becoming-censorship" class="header-anchor">Fact-Checking Becoming Censorship</a></h3>
<p>Fact-checking has become just another word for censorship. In a recent vice presidential debate, CBS News moderators attempted to fact-check Sen. JD Vance and demonstrated one of the big problems in this media era: they only seemed interested in fact-checking in one direction - against the Republican candidate.</p>
<p>During the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan decided to fact-check something that Vance said and immediately relayed a piece of false information herself. This instance reveals that not only do these "fact-checkers" frequently get their facts wrong, but also they are selective about which facts to correct. In this case, it was clearly against Vance.</p>
<h3 id="issues-with-media's-role-in-fact-checking" tabindex="-1"><a href="#issues-with-media's-role-in-fact-checking" class="header-anchor">Issues with Media's Role in Fact-Checking</a></h3>
<p>The problem lies in the fact that many media institutions are not competent at determining what is true or false. The era of social media has seen a dilution of power in traditional gatekeepers like newspapers and TV networks. New platforms allow anyone to point out inaccuracies, thereby questioning the previous control over narratives.</p>
<p>Media's Role: Gatekeeper vs. Story Selector</p>
<p>There used to be a time when newspapers could suppress certain stories, but with technological advancements, it is no longer possible to hide everything from the public eye. However, some media houses still try to select what to publish or not publish in order to suit a particular narrative, making them more untrustworthy than ever.</p>
<h3 id="public-awareness-and-perception" tabindex="-1"><a href="#public-awareness-and-perception" class="header-anchor">Public Awareness and Perception</a></h3>
<p>The public has grown wiser in understanding these strategies. For instance, they can easily find a story that a media house tries to suppress by resorting to alternative platforms. But it also exposes the transparent and increasingly less trustworthy nature of such selective publishing houses.</p>
<p>When it comes to October surprises or other political tactics, people are not easily fooled anymore. They know that these tricks are expected during election times, so they do not fall for them as easily as before.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a href="#conclusion" class="header-anchor">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>The fact-checking phenomenon has evolved into a tool for censorship in the wrong hands. Media organizations claiming neutrality and fairness often show clear biases or selectivity in their fact-checking approach, making it easier to identify their partisan leanings rather than being seen as unbiased or impartial gatekeepers of information.</p>
<h3 id="image" tabindex="-1"><a href="#image" class="header-anchor">Image</a></h3>

<p>This image captures a moment from what appears to be a political debate or discussion. The main subject is a man in professional attire, consisting of a dark suit and red tie with an American flag pin on his lapel, suggesting he might be involved in politics or public speaking. He stands against the backdrop of a large screen displaying another individual seated at a desk labeled 'CBS News Vice Presidential Debate'. This suggests that the image is taken during such a political event where media coverage is prominent. The setting indicates a formal and serious atmosphere, typical for televised political events aimed at informing voters about candidates' policies and visions for leadership roles like vice president or higher office.</p>

<p>In modern days a term has sprung up
To quell all speech that dares to stir and sup,
Yet far from noble or virtuous act,
It serves the powers with views to protect.</p>
<p>This 'fact-checking', like false news of old,
Doth lie in eye beholder to behold.
Once meant to keep the truth above the fray,
Now it's a tool for those in power's play.</p>
<p>No longer is the aim just simple truth
The goal now is the censor's silent oath.
A way to stop all speech that dares annoy,
And force the views of power upon all.</p>
<p>This game was played at VP debate last week,
Where 'fact-checkers' tried one-sided heck.
On Springfield, Ohio, they sought to pounce,
But truth did hide as falsehood took its dance.</p>
<p>Let not us be like birds who tweet and chirp
At those below, while we sit on our perch.
For if we join in this game of hate and scorn,
We play right into the hands of those for whom
This system serves: the powers that be,
Who use it to keep down speech you and I.</p>
<p>So let us seek a higher way than this
Of censuring those who think amiss.
Instead, let reason light our path ahead,
And help us see truth not obscured by dread.
For in the end, 'tis wisdom helps us steer
Away from conflict fueled by fear and ire.</p>
<p>But should we find as one our common core,
Then truth might rise above control's sore fight.</p>
<p>Thus shall we strive to show that speech can soar
Beyond the reach of those who would deplore,
And give to all an ear to think and speak.
That truth might rise unbridled, free and meek.</p>
<p>But if like me you too have played this game,
Then change your tune from scorn to truth's sweet aim.
For in the end our goal should not be strife,
But speech unchained, uncensored, free as life.</p>

<p>In a time where truth doth hide,
A new tool's risen from the tide.
Fact-checking, once pure and bright,
Has turned its back on right and light.</p>
<p>Through CBS stage, this fact did fall:
Vance was checked by Brennan's call.
But her words, they too, did lie,
Revealing bias, blind eye.</p>
<h3 id="issues-with-media's-role-in-fact-checking-1" tabindex="-1"><a href="#issues-with-media's-role-in-fact-checking-1" class="header-anchor">Issues with Media's Role in Fact-Checking</a></h3>
<p>Control once held firm over tale,
Newspapers ruled without bale.
But times have changed, and power's gone,
Each voice can now be heard on.</p>
<p>Gatekeepers turned to story's choice,
Untrustworthy, biased, no surprise.
Yet public knows their games too well,
In transparency they dwell.</p>
<h3 id="public-awareness-and-perception-1" tabindex="-1"><a href="#public-awareness-and-perception-1" class="header-anchor">Public Awareness and Perception</a></h3>
<p>They see through masks and lies that tell,
October surprises don't dwell.
No longer fooled by old-time schemes,
Awareness keeps them from the dreams.</p>
<p>Public's grown in wisdom, true,
Knowing tricks are not anew.
Through channels new and various,
Truth seeks pathways disparate.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-1" tabindex="-1"><a href="#conclusion-1" class="header-anchor">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>Fact-checking, now a tool of shame,
Censorship dressed as virtuous claim.
Media's part doth often blur,
Showing leanings, clear as hurrah!</p>
<p>Unbiased they claim to be,
But fact's twisted truth for all to see.
In selectivity they hide,
Truth's gatekeepers, in decay they slide.</p>

<p>A man of stance with suit's embrace,
And tie of red to grace his face.
An eagle's banner pin adorns
His lapel, a symbol of the powers that be at norms.</p>
<p>On large screen's stage, 'CBS News Vice'
Is writ as claimant of the dice.
A desk doth sit another there,<br>
For all to view and ponder fair.</p>
<p>Such scenes, they craft the public eye,
In formal setting, high stake's tie.
Where visions grand for leading roles
And policies with voter's souls.</p>
<p>Thus does this shot a moment hold,
Of weighty talk 'tween minds so bold.</p>
