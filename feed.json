In a recent vice presidential debate, CBS News moderators attempted to fact-check Sen. JD Vance and demonstrated one of the big problems in this media era: they only seemed interested in fact-checking in one direction - against the Republican candidate.</p>\n<p>During the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan decided to fact-check something that Vance said and immediately relayed a piece of false information herself. This instance reveals that not only do these &quot;fact-checkers&quot; frequently get their facts wrong, but also they are selective about which facts to correct. In this case, it was clearly against Vance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"issues-with-media's-role-in-fact-checking\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"http://localhost:3000/posts/url/factcheckhasbec-p/#issues-with-media's-role-in-fact-checking\" class=\"header-anchor\">Issues with Media's Role in Fact-Checking</a></h3>\n<p>The problem lies in the fact that many media institutions are not competent at determining what is true or false. The era of social media has seen a dilution of power in traditional gatekeepers like newspapers and TV networks. New platforms allow anyone to point out inaccuracies, thereby questioning the previous control over narratives.</p>\n<p>Media's Role: Gatekeeper vs. Story Selector</p>\n<p>There used to be a time when newspapers could suppress certain stories, but with technological advancements, it is no longer possible to hide everything from the public eye. However, some media houses still try to select what to publish or not publish in order to suit a particular narrative, making them more untrustworthy than ever.</p>\n<h3 id=\"public-awareness-and-perception\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"http://localhost:3000/posts/url/factcheckhasbec-p/#public-awareness-and-perception\" class=\"header-anchor\">Public Awareness and Perception</a></h3>\n<p>The public has grown wiser in understanding these strategies. For instance, they can easily find a story that a media house tries to suppress by resorting to alternative platforms. But it also exposes the transparent and increasingly less trustworthy nature of such selective publishing houses.</p>\n<p>When it comes to October surprises or other political tactics, people are not easily fooled anymore. They know that these tricks are expected during election times, so they do not fall for them as easily as before.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"http://localhost:3000/posts/url/factcheckhasbec-p/#conclusion\" class=\"header-anchor\">Conclusion</a></h3>\n<p>The fact-checking phenomenon has evolved into a tool for censorship in the wrong hands. Media organizations claiming neutrality and fairness often show clear biases or selectivity in their fact-checking approach, making it easier to identify their partisan leanings rather than being seen as unbiased or impartial gatekeepers of information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"image\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"http://localhost:3000/posts/url/factcheckhasbec-p/#image\" class=\"header-anchor\">Image</a></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/newspress-collage-j0lto3hrv-1727992491394.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;1727978131&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This image captures a moment from what appears to be a political debate or discussion. The main subject is a man in professional attire, consisting of a dark suit and red tie with an American flag pin on his lapel, suggesting he might be involved in politics or public speaking. He stands against the backdrop of a large screen displaying another individual seated at a desk labeled 'CBS News Vice Presidential Debate'. This suggests that the image is taken during such a political event where media coverage is prominent. The setting indicates a formal and serious atmosphere, typical for televised political events aimed at informing voters about candidates' policies and visions for leadership roles like vice president or higher office.</p>\n<h3 id=\"verse\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"http://localhost:3000/posts/url/factcheckhasbec-p/#verse\" class=\"header-anchor\">Verse</a></h3>\n<h3 id=\"fact-check-censorship\"

quell all speech that dares to stir and sup,\nYet far from noble or virtuous act,\nIt serves the powers with views to protect.</p>\n<p>This 'fact-checking', like false news of old,\nDoth lie in eye beholder to behold.\nOnce meant to keep the truth above the fray,\nNow it's a tool for those in power's play.</p>\n<p>No longer is the aim just simple truth\nThe goal now is the censor's silent oath.\nA way to stop all speech that dares annoy,\nAnd force the views of power upon all.</p>\n<p>This game was played at VP debate last week,\nWhere 'fact-checkers' tried one-sided heck.\nOn Springfield, Ohio, they sought to pounce,\nBut truth did hide as falsehood took its dance.</p>\n<p>Let not us be like birds who tweet and chirp\nAt those below, while we sit on our perch.\nFor if we join in this game of hate and scorn,\nWe play right into the hands of those for whom\nThis system serves: the powers that be,\nWho use it to keep down speech you and I.</p>\n<p>So let us seek a higher way than this\nOf censuring those who think amiss.\nInstead, let reason light our path ahead,\nAnd help us see truth not obscured by dread.\nFor in the end, 'tis wisdom helps us steer\nAway from conflict fueled by fear and ire.</p>\n<p>But should we find as one our common core,\nThen truth might rise above control's sore fight.</p>\n<p>Thus shall we strive to show that speech can soar\nBeyond the reach of those who would deplore,\nAnd give to all an ear to think and speak.\nThat truth might rise unbridled, free and meek.</p>\n<p>But if like me you too have played this game,\nThen change your tune from scorn to truth's sweet aim.\nFor in the end our goal should not be strife,\nBut speech unchained, uncensored, free as life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a

Vance's Victory in VP Debate</a></h3>\n<p>In iambic pentameter:\nTulsi Gabbard speaks, her words alight,\nWith truth unbound, like flames against the night.\nHer gaze upon the stage, a piercing sight,\nWhere Vance and Walz did clash their views in flight.</p>\n<p>A Democrat she stands, but not confined\nTo party lines; her vision broad and kind.\nFor those who seek Trump's vote to find,\nIn Vance's command, an answer primed.</p>\n<p>The issues wrestled 'twixt the candidates,\nDid leave the minds of viewers recompensed.\nA different view on policies defended,\nWith positive impact, their thoughts endorsed.</p>\n<p>But media's role, a bias undenied,\nIn pockets deep of Harris' campaign tied.\nVance's talk, a reflection of the real,\nTo people's needs and Trump's aims appealed.</p>\n<p>Contrasted with what came from Clinton's heir,\nThe promises and arrogance laid bare.\nYet Walz did struggle in defense so rare,\nHis words, a tough job but ill-prepared.</p>\n<p>The moment that crystallized all tonight?\nThe censorship under Harris brought to light.\nA double standard, the free speech fight,\nVance's stance on what's right shone bright.</p>\n<p>And Gabbard, though dismayed at current state,\nBelieves in Trump and freedom's weight.\nThe issues, from economy to hate,\nReveal a choice that must be debated.</p>\n<p>In voting Trump, Americans see,\nA chance to stand for what matters thee.</p>\n<h3 id=\"\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"http://localhost:3000/posts/url/54tulsigabbardt-p/#\" class=\"header-anchor\"></a></h3>\n<p>Poem</p>\n<h3

words, like arrows from the hell.</p>\n<p>Commanding issues, he did show,\nThe policies that Trump did know.\nWith relatable speech and spell,\nHe turned many hearts to dwell.</p>\n<p>But media bias, a shadow cast,\nDistorted truth, as time hath past.\nOpen minds to Vance were drawn,\nBy his honest ways, like morning's dawn.</p>\n<p>Contrast of approaches clear to see,\nVance and Trump, more free than key.\nHarris and kin, distant, cold,\nTheir struggles not by stories told.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-significance-of-free-speech-in-the-election-1\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a

speech, a gem that we must hold,\nFor without it, truth is sold.\nIn elections past, Gabbard did declare,\nWalz's stance unclear, or so we fare.</p>\n<p>Yet, a double standard we see,\nSome words protected, some to be.\nWhile others banned by decree,\nA free republic, thus we flee.</p>\n<p>Censorship too, in personal attack,\nAnd misinformation cast back.\nFor all must speak what lies within,\nOr our democracy shall lose its skin.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-importance-of-taking-responsibility-1\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a

doth require,\nTo take the blame and be sincere.\nTim Walz, thy policies were laid bare,\nYet deflected, like a knight in scare.</p>\n<p>True leaders own their misdeeds done,\nAccountability must be spun.\nFor trust is lost when errors swept away,\nAnd thus our faith shall fade each day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"free-speech-and-political-retaliation-1\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a

of woe,\nPlaced on list for words once spoken low.\nQuiet Skies program did unfold,\nA story of control, a tale untold.</p>\n<p>ACLJ by her side stood strong,\nAs battles in courts became the song.\nMany others wrongfully targeted were,\nBy government hands that sought to steer.</p>\n<p>Free speech extended beyond just say,\nBut retaliation's hand to swayed.\nWe must stand together, hearts and minds,\nFor truth's sake we shall not resign.</p>\n<h3 id=\"appreciation-for-courageous-voices-1\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a
